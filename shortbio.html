			 <p class-"card-text"> Currently, I am finishing my undergraduate degree within the University of Iowa's Environmental Policy and Planner Bachelor's of Science. To further expand upon my base knowledge in the environmental management curriculum, I am also obtaining two minors, one in GIS and the other in Urban Studies.
			 My interests lie within the built environment, urban and regional planning, and Iowa's natural ecology. After graduation, I hope to continue my studies by attending a masters program that will capture the all of my interests and allow me to better both my environments and the communities I work for.
			 After my sophomore year as a Bachelor's student, I had the opportunity to become a summer reasearch intern with the National University of Singapore's Lloyd's Register Foundation for the Public Understanding of Risk. During my time in Singapore, I further developed my secondary research skills alongside a small team of individuals.
			 This opportunity not only allowed me to expand my international network, but I was tasked with developing my own case study on the Sewol Ferry Tragedy of 2014 to better understand the developments of maritime regulatory policy before and after the accident.
			 Between my junior year and my final semester of my undergraduate program, I will take on a new role as an Economic Developer Project Intern with the City of Urbandale Iowa's Economic Development team. This opportunity will allow me to make long-lasting connections with private companies and public non-profits within the City of Urbandale as I prompt public community engagement. </p>
